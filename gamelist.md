PRE:_UDE | Love's Lost Requiem is an otome psychological horror game, where you (MC) seem to be homebound with only the physical company of your childhood friend, Ravi. 
For PRE:_UDE | Love's Lost Requiem, I was a beta tester, ensuring the game's functionality (working UI, music, spelling, bugs). Play on the site or download and play the demo <a href="https://elduator.itch.io/prelude">here</a>.  <br><br>
My beta testing involved comprehensive playthroughs on various systems to identify critical bugs, UI/UX issues, and areas of potential confusion for the player. I provided detailed feedback on the pacing, narrative coherence, and overall player experience to help polish the final product before launch.
