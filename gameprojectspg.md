Together, two mice detectives, Raz Berries and Sunny Whisk, investigate a museum robbery as they travel to Twintails, Raz's hometown. 
This game was part of a thesis project - and I collaborated by being a play-tester and proofreader for the script while also being a mentor for the programmer of the game dev group.  <br>
<br>
As a play-tester, I focused on identifying and reporting critical bugs, evaluating the puzzle difficulty, and assessing the overall user experience flow. My role as proofreader involved meticulously checking the script for grammatical errors, consistency in character dialogue, and ensuring the mystery narrative was clear and engaging for the player.
