## About 
Hi, I’m Elizabeth, a Bay Area dweller with a love for all things cute. By day, I'm a Data Scientist. By night, I'm an indie game developer - part of <a href="https://pixelboltgames.wixsite.com/pixelbolt-games">PixelBolt </a> team- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cutebrainpants">inspiring Youtuber</a>, and a hobby artist, exploring my creative side after hours. 🎨🎮

<h2> The Woeful Rose & The Bitter Crow </h2>
After years as the Truthlight of Soleil (and surviving its hazards), Leone thought moving to Roque would bring peace. But a string of strange deaths shatters the calm, forcing them to collaborate with two unusual Warden cultists. Amidst historical religious tensions, Leone must uncover the cause of the deaths, facing a choice between open-mindedness and potentially fatal prejudice. Could this investigation lead to new bonds of friendship or love? The demo was originally part of OjiJam jam, but I'm an editor on the post-jam! Play the OjiJam Jam release of the <a  href = "https://itch.io/queue/c/3000724/the-sacrarium-universe?game_id=1926034"> game </a> in the meantime as the full game is about to be released! <br>

PRE:_UDE | Love's Lost Requiem is an otome psychological horror game, where you (MC) seem to be homebound with only the physical company of your childhood friend, Ravi. 
For PRE:_UDE | Love's Lost Requiem, I was a beta tester, ensuring the game's functionality (working UI, music, spelling, bugs).<br> Play on the site or download and play the demo <a href="https://elduator.itch.io/prelude">here</a>.  <br><br>
